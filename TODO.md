I was too tired to keep going on this as the project is gaining in complexity and I am very
grateful to be working with git in a branch and knowing that I can stop if I get overwhelmed.

I realized that I created the program to work with a config file but I didn't ask the coder to verify
that everything would work with this and to set things up to use a constaant value.

There are many parts of this that, I am sure if it were examined properly it would be a very eye\
opening thing.

I have downloaded the most recent code updates but I have not created files for them. as of this morning at 5:05 am
